<h1>Are you ready for 39c3?</h1>

<p>At <strong>Chaos Mentors</strong>, we connect experienced mentors with people attending Congress for the first time. Our goal is to make the Congress experience welcoming, smooth, and inspiring, whether you're new to the community, curious but unsure, or just want some company to explore this huge and exciting event.</p>

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>Many of us have been coming to Congress for years, some for 2, others for 20 or more, but we all remember the first time: overwhelming schedules, endless rooms, the feeling of "Where do I even start?". Thoughts like, "Do I belong at a big hacker conference?" are familiar to many of us. But the answer is: absolutely yes! Congress is about curiosity, creativity, and people, and it grows richer with every new perspective that joins.</p>

<h2>Who are the Chaos Mentors for?</h2>

<p>If this is your first Congress, if you don't know many people yet, or if you're unsure how to dive into the buzzing chaos of talks, workshops, and assemblies – Chaos Mentors are here for you.</p>

<p>As a Chaos Mentee you'll be matched with a mentor and a small group of fellow mentees. Together with us you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions and get insider tips</li>
  <li>Explore workshops and Congress talks</li>
  <li>Find quiet spots to recharge</li>
  <li>Discover hidden corners and social gatherings</li>
  <li>Share experiences and connect with others</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned hacker, an artist, a student, or just someone curious about technology and culture. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<h2>Call for Mentors</h2>

<p>We're once again looking for friendly, reliable mentors to guide newcomers. If you are an experienced Congress-goer and enjoy sharing your knowledge and helping others discover this amazing event, consider signing up. Your support helps build a more open, connected, and welcoming community.</p>
