<h1>Are you ready for 39c3?</h1>

<p>At <strong>Chaos Mentors</strong>, we connect experienced mentors with people attending Congress for the first time. Our goal is to make the Congress experience welcoming, smooth, and inspiring, whether you're new to the community, curious but unsure, or just want some company to explore this huge and exciting event.</p>

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>Many of us have been coming to Congress for years, some for 2, others for 20 or more, but we all remember the first time: overwhelming schedules, endless rooms, the feeling of "Where do I even start?". Thoughts like, "Do I belong at a big hacker conference?" are familiar to many of us. But the answer is: absolutely yes! Congress is about curiosity, creativity, and people, and it grows richer with every new perspective that joins.</p>

<h2>Who are the Chaos Mentors for?</h2>

<p>If this is your first Congress, if you don't know many people yet, or if you're unsure how to dive into the buzzing chaos of talks, workshops, and assemblies – Chaos Mentors are here for you.</p>

<p>As a Chaos Mentee you'll be matched with a mentor and a small group of fellow mentees. Together with us you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions and get insider tips</li>
  <li>Explore workshops and Congress talks</li>
  <li>Find quiet spots to recharge</li>
  <li>Discover hidden corners and social gatherings</li>
  <li>Share experiences and connect with others</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned hacker, an artist, a student, or just someone curious about technology and culture. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<h2>Call for Mentors</h2>

<p>We're once again looking for friendly, reliable mentors to guide newcomers. If you are an experienced Congress-goer and enjoy sharing your knowledge and helping others discover this amazing event, consider signing up. Your support helps build a more open, connected, and welcoming community.</p>

<h2>Registration is now open!</h2>

<p><strong>Register by 25 November 2025, 23:59 UTC+1</strong> and tell us a bit about yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What brings you to Congress?</li>
  <li>What interests you most?</li>
  <li>Do you have specific needs we should consider?</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps us match you with a mentor and group that fits your vibe. Your mentor will reach out before Congress so you can already get to know each other — and once Congress starts, you'll have friendly faces to meet, explore, and share the experience with.</p>

<h2>The Chaosmentors registration for the 39C3 is now closed!</h2>

<p>We are now starting the matching process. As a mentor, you will receive an email in the coming days with all the information about your mentees. If you are a mentee, please be patient until your mentor reaches out to you.</p>

<p><strong>Missed the registration?</strong> On day 1 and day 2 we can still assign a few mentees to groups on site. Just come to our assembly and talk to the Chaos Mentors. You’ll recognize us by our colorful propeller hats. Shortly before Congress, we will appear in <a target="_blank" href="https://c3nav.de/">C3Nav</a> – it will guide you straight to our assembly.</p>
