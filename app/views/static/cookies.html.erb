<h1>Cookies</h1>

<p>Cookies are small text files which are downloaded to your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you visit a website or application. 
The website or application may retrieve these cookies from your web browser (eg Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) 
each time you visit, so they can recognise you, remember your preferences and provide you with a more secure online experience.</p>

<p>Generally, cookies are very useful and are a common method used by almost every website you visit because they help to make your 
online experience as smooth as possible. For security reasons, many websites will not function at all without the use of cookies 
(or other similar technologies, such as "web beacons" or "tags").</p>

<p>Cookies generally do not hold any information to identify an individual person, but are instead used to identify a browser on an individual machine.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can restrict, block or delete cookies by changing your browser settings but that may mean that the website won't work properly.</p>

<h2>COOKIES WE USE</h2>

<p>We only use cookies, that are essential for the operation of this service. In detail, the service will set two cookies on your
browser. One, to store that you have clicked on <em>OK</em> in the cookie banner, in case you did so. The second one is the session
cookie descibed below.</p>

<h3>Session Cookies</h3>

<p>When you use the <em>Register as Mentee</em> or <em>Register as Mentor</em> function, the server will send a session cookie to your browser. 
This cookie contains a cryptographic hash (something like a digital signature), that allows the service to identify your 
session, while you are using the service. This is necessary, because you will see, some personalised information, that is linked to the information you
just sent. The same is true, if you use the login page, in case you are a godmother.<p>

<p>The cookie expires automatically, the moment you close your browser.</p>

<p>This cookie is an essential part of our service, meaning the site cannot work without it.</p>

<p>We do not pass any information on to third parties, and do not use the cookie information to track you from third party sites <p/>
