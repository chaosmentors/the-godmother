Hi <%= @person.name %>,

This is a friendly reminder to confirm your ticket status for Chaosmentors.

We noticed you haven't yet confirmed whether you have a conference ticket. This is important because we can only match you with <%= @person.role_name == 'mentor' ? 'mentees' : 'a mentor' %> if you have a valid conference ticket.

Please take a moment to update your ticket status by clicking the link below:
<%= [Rails.configuration.x.app_url, 'conference_ticket', @person.verification_token, 'edit'].join('/') %>

If you have any questions or need help, just reply to this email.

Thank you for being part of Chaosmentors!

Best regards,
The Chaosmentors Team
