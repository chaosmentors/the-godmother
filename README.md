# README

The God Mother is a tool for organizing mentors and mentees. This is useful for community-organized conferences and other events.

Current functionality allows for:
 * Mentors and Mentees ("Ment*") to register, with email verification
 * When signing up, Ment* are able to introduce themselves and "tag" themselves with arbitraty tags (i.e. interests, preferred language, etc.)
 * The "God Mothers" are able to use the tool to organize the Ment* into groups.
 * "God Mothers" are also able to add additional tags to Ment* in order to assist in groupmaking

For more information, and instructions on how to get The Godmother running, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/chaosmentors/the-godmother/wiki)
